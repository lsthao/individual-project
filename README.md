### Problem Statement

I love to post pictures of foods that I eat and I love to look at pictures that other people post. I also love trying new restaurants and foods, however I don't always know what's out there. What better way to find restaurant recommendations than by creating a picture sharing site where fellow foodies can come together and share their favorite meals at their favorite spots. Each picture that a user posts will include the restaurant information so that if you see something you want to try, you'll know exactly where to go.
